# ToDoList_DotNetWPF_SQLServer
a Pratice project to get me back to the basics of interfacing with a database using only WPF  

# Things To Add
- A new DataBase table and interface to contain a list of completed Tasks 
- User accounts replace the Id with USER ID and make sure that Useres can only add, delete and complete there own task 
- A super User account that can assign a task to any user.
